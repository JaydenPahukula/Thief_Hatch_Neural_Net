**Thief Hatch Nueral Network**

By: Jayden Pahukula

This model is trained on pressure data from oil tanks to be able to predict when the thief hatch is open.

NOTE:
-model_training.ipynb is used to train the neural network model, then it is saved to models/model.
-be sure to run model_training.ipynb if it isn't already built.
-then run main.ipynb to run the model
